# vu-ml notes

These are some latex notes for the more math heavy lectures of the [machine learning course](https://mlvu.github.io/) taught for undergrads at VU Amsterdam. [Here](https://lausta.notion.site/f2782a8d0c3341d595c4bc1526c330a8?pvs=25) are the full notes (which include these). 

## notes 

- `lec0-prob.pdf` : very basic probability essentials
- `lec2.pdf` : linear models and search
- `lec4.pdf` : probalistic models
- `lec6.pdf` : neural networks and backpropagation 

### additional 

- `cond-ent.pdf` : an unecessarily long explanation to conditional entropy and its application, based in part of [these slides](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/fmcs1/slides/lecture25.pdf)
